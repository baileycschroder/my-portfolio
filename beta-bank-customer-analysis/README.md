# Beta Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn for Beta Bank and builds a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to leave. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using F1 and AUC-ROC metrics.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`Churn.csv`)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with all analysis and modeling (`beta-bank-customer-analysis.ipynb`)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells.

## Results

- Achieved validation F1 score above 0.59 (target threshold).
- See the notebook for detailed metrics and discussion.
