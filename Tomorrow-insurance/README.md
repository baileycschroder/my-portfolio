# Tomorrow Insurance Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn for Tomorrow Insurance and builds a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to leave. The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using F1 and AUC-ROC metrics.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (e.g., `insurance_churn.csv`)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with all analysis and modeling (`tomorrow-insurance.ipynb`)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells.

## Results

- Built and evaluated models to predict customer churn.
- Compared F1 and AUC-ROC metrics to select the best model.
- See the notebook for detailed analysis and results.
