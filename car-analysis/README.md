# Car Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of cars to uncover insights about vehicle features, pricing, and trends. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (e.g., `cars.csv`)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with all analysis and modeling (`car-analysis.ipynb`)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells.

## Results

- Explored car features and pricing trends.
- Built and evaluated models to predict car prices or other outcomes.
- See the notebook for detailed analysis and results.
